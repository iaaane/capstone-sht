                    <p>We had an activity on shool and I got to choose several defense mechanisms and share our personal experiences so here is one I wrote which talks about nomadism as a defense mechanism.</p>

                    <p>There was a time in my life where it felt like everything was wrong. I wasn’t fulfilling my goals, priorities and values. Everything was just really bad with several aspects in my life like with my family, relationships, school and other more things. I did feel pretty down. It was a long weekend, classes were suspended for some occasions and on a random day I bought a ticket to Manila, didn’t have any plans at all like really not a single plan. I thought of just figuring out what to do when I get there and things turned just fine when I was there already. I just wanted to be on my own and sort of like finding myself and assessing what is wrong and what should I do to make things right and better. So I put some clothes on my backpack and departed to Manila. I arrived at Manila on morning the next day and just spent the whole day going from places I’ve never been to, sipping coffee and getting food, stroll at malls, taking train transits and just basically getting into one place to another by myself. For the night I went on and visit some friends and stayed there until the next morning. The next day was Sunday. We hangout and just basically catching up with one another. I took the bus going back to Baguio City later at night that day feeling actually better and refreshed ready to get back to track.</p>

                    <p>With this random trip I realized that sometimes it is actually good to be alone because you will get to know yourself better. After that trip I felt really really good and then I started to long more for personal growth and bettering myself. I actually have a bunch of life goals on different aspects of my life like finance, leverage, traveling and other more bunch of goals. Sometimes I could really get my ass off to work for those goals but I honestly get lost oftentimes and constantly battling myself to be better and just moving forward you know. I got big goals, not ordinary, which I am confidently could achieve if I could just stick to my short term goals, long term and plans. I just don’t wanna live life like most of the people who are contented settling down having and doing what most of the people do and contented with. I don’t want an average life. Life is too short to live like that way. There are a lot of things life has to offer if you know what I mean.</p>
