                <p>I am a tech person. I love everything about technology. I like just how easy it is to learn a lot of things and the easy access of information. I like reading about random stuff, especially essential topics that I think would add up to my knowledge about certain fields I like to learn about and that could hugely mold how I understand and see things on perspective.</p>
                <p>I am also into stock market. Though I could be considered as a starter on this field, I like how complicated it looks like in general when looking through charts and multiple computer monitor setups that contain different kinds of data. I've started initially like have already tested the water and I did love it. I see myself active trading in the near future. For the mean time I am currently working on the kickstarter fund. </p>
                <p>Traveling! Just the idea of it, awesome. The first time I was able to step on a foreign country, it felt great. I've been reading a lot about places to the extent that though I haven't gone to those certain places, it's like I already know how to roam around on those because I read a lot about them like on how to get there, things to do and stuff. One goal in my bucket list is to be able to travel countries in the Southeast Asia for a month or two, probably on early 20s. Got to get myself huge projects to earn that funding huh haha.</p>
                <p>I am also currently working on a tech startup right now. I've been reading a lot of magazines and articles on businesses lately especially on startups. I got these crazy ideas that if only I could learn the necessary programming languages and skills to build those ideas, I surely will work as a digital nomad and could make a living on freelancing. The best part of it would be is that I will be able to travel a lot and work for myself with no boss.</p>
                <p>I have a bucketlist. Got a lot of goals, growth lists and other lists and stuff. As much as possible I don't wanna live life ordinarily, like I don't want average at all on every sort of what I will have, I will do and I will become in the future. I think life is too short to settle down and aim for average living. Life got a lot of things to offer. I might not be living the way I dream myself to be, but sure I am grinding hard for it.</p>
                <p>The sail has began, I refuse to sink.</p>
