                    <p>One time while browsing the internet, a random blog led me to the idea of investing while I am still on school and is still early. I've heard about stock market in one of my business subjects in school so that the random blog got my attention and led me on thinking if I should go into buying equities. I was convinced immediately into investing into since every month I could save an amount of extra money and often times I just use it for spending random expenses that I really don’t need that much which makes me regret at the end. Then I realized why not invest it instead. So, the moment I thought about investing into stocks, I immediately turned to the internet for tips and information about stock market.</p>

                    <p>I turned to COL financial for my broker. They require at least 5000 pesos to start and with that you get an access to the Philippine market data streaming and a web based functional trading platform. I chose it because I wanted to trade and invest independently since I knew things already which I got from reading and learning from internet. You will also get a full control of your investments and it is much more cheaper than an actual traditional human broker. So second half of last year I was at the phase of “testing the water”. I bought shares from two companies which were from JFC and BDO, the prices went up through the term of four months and so I gained a little amount. One mistake though was that when I sold my shares too soon it instantly when we went to Dubai for vacation because I got too excited perhaps. Now I currently got zero balance in my account and I need to start all over again. But for the mean time since I am still on school, I guess I might just put some little fund in there but will not yet focus on it that much because I wanna have fun I guess, and I don’t wanna get too thrifty for myself just for now. At least I got to try out investing and really care about securing myself financially in the future right? And honestly, I wanted to day trade in the future while travelling. Maybe get a job first for head start, then invest and trade, build a business, quit job, be my own boss and have a leverage then I could get myself getting into places traveling. One day man, one day. haha</p>

                    <p>So yea, at least I have experienced and got myself introduced to the stock market at 19 y/o. Not really bad.</p>
