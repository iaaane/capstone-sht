                    <p>Many people often judge others with their certain issues in school. Maybe one has failed in a subject or two, or he/she shifted from a course to another. Or maybe someone is still taking school more than the regular schooling term, which is in the range of four years up to five depending on one’s course and school.</p>

                    <p>Grades basically show how students perform in school. It partly defines one’s intelligence but not completely, accurately and always. There are factors affecting a student’s grades. From a student’s personal issues to the professor’s method that fucking sucks. I think the factors regarding a student’s personal issues include negligence, disobedience and stupidity. Maybe a student fails because of having one or more of those given issues but who knows if he/she has other methods of learning which he finds more comfortable and productive more than school. Or maybe his/her school and professors just simply suck and slow which degrades his drive to be more active in the school. Every individual’s knowledge and perspective is developed and molded by his environment and experiences. The school isn’t only the place where people learn and develop skills. I am not saying that you could just ignore school or be fine with passing to average grades because good grades still will get you better opportunities when finding a work already more than average and passing grades.</p>

                    <p>People should stop judging someone with their grades. Now, for those who are still freshies and folks out there with no to little records in their transcript yet, aim to get better grades. For better grades I mean above average. Never live average. Fuck average. Be weird and different. And for people with bad records and just recently realized that their transcript is ugly already, don’t get disappointed. Your future is not judged by your grades. Grades are just numbers. We have the Filipino word called diskarte that will get you a good job. Just continue to learn and cultivate your skill in your passion and you’re good then.
Remember, KNOWLEDGE is POWER. But don’t be stupid, study hard and make your transcript look sizzling hot hahaha</p>
