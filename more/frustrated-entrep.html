                    <p>I have been in a constant battle with myself for a long time. One day I am in control with myself living by my priorities and doing things that get me closer to my goals and what I want myself to be in the future, but often times this another persona in me gets in control that I start doing things that grant short term happiness but later on get me in my lowest point because those activities make me  procrastinate so bad. </p>
                    <p>I crave so much self growth. I have been craving for a long time but I often get lost by doing things that give short term happiness and make me procrastinate. I have goals, infact they are well planned step by step, from smaller goals to achieve bigger goals. But I failed so hard by procrastinating.</p>
                    <p>One instance is with my startup goal. I basically have five core goals in life. One of them is to launch an online startup. It was a community website, kind of a small social network that has a potential to get monetized and get me a passive living from it. So I reccon'ed, was able to make a fine blueprint, and I had a timeline. I even spent so much time learning necessary skills to build it. I started to code and was able to complete the prototype by about 20%. I swear that is a long time and lot of sacrifices. I spent more time just by myself online and lesser time with social involvement. I was learning skills and was coding. My mindset was with the long term thinking that if only I could focus and do this for like 6 months but of a lesser fun life, then it would be life changing and would be a great sense of accomplishment. But I was lost man. I went partying, drinking, spending money on things that I don't even need and other things that give only short term happiness.
                    <p>Building a startup requires a different lifestyle unlike the way I used to have. Blah blah blah.. (continue)</p>
